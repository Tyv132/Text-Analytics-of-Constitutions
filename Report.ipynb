    "In 1787, 55 men from 12 states met in Philadelphia, PA to create the framework for the constitution of the United States [[1]](https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&psid=3231). At the time this was the first complete, written national constitution; however, the idea of a single constitution as a guide for governments became popular around the world. In 2023, over two centuries later, there are now 193 national constitutions in effect. Unlike the American constitution, new constitutions tend to be much longer because they govern more institutions (such as central banks and the military) and include more rights (such as more social, cultural, and economic rights) [[2]](https://constitutioncenter.org/education/classroom-resource-library/classroom/perspectives-on-the-constitution-constitutions-around-the-world).  \n",
    "\n",
    "While a constitution is a fundamental building block of a nation's government and laws, it is also a reflection of the social and cultural values of the society. The WORLD Policy Analysis Center is one organization working to study constitutions to understand how their explicit mention of citizen's rights shapes legislation and policies [[3]](https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/about/about-world). Their research involves the comparison of constitutional rights in various categories, including education, health, and religion. Two examples comparisons are shown for constitutional rights to higher education (Figure 1) and protections of health (Figure 2).\n"

    "These analyses demonstrate the utility of using text analytics to explore the differences between countries based on their constitutions. Applying hierarchical clustering resulted in the finding that countries from the same continent were more likely to be grouped together based on the frequency of terms used in their constitution. Principal component analysis uncovered the key phrases differentiating republics and monarchies. Topic modeling allowed for insight into which words were most associated with authoritarian or fully democratic countries. Word embeddings displayed additional clusterings of words related to more detailed topics, such as preserving traditions or citizenship. Finally, word shift graphs were used to find the most significant terms dinstinguishing each constitution to allow for direct comparison. "
